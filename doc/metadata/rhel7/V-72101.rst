The STIG requires that all ``lchown`` syscalls are audited, but this change
creates a significant increase in logging on most systems. This increase can
cause some systems to run out of disk space for logs.

.. warning::

    This rule is disabled by default to avoid high CPU usage and disk space
    exhaustion. Deployers should only enable this rule if they have tested it
    thoroughly in a non-production environment with system health monitoring
    enabled.

Deployers can opt in for this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_audit_lchown: yes

This rule is compatible with x86, x86_64, and ppc64 architectures.
