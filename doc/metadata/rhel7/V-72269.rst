The tasks in the security role make the following changes on each host:

* The ``chrony`` package is installed.
* The service (``chronyd`` on Red Hat and CentOS, ``chrony`` on Ubuntu) is
  started and enabled at boot time.
* A configuration file template is deployed that includes ``maxpoll 10`` on
  each server line.

Deployers can opt out of these changes by setting the following Ansible
variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

  security_rhel7_enable_chrony: no

.. note::

    Although the STIG mentions the traditional ``ntpd`` service, this role uses
    ``chrony``, which is a more modern implementation.
