The ``CREATE_HOME`` variable is set to ``yes`` by the tasks in the security
role. This ensures that home directories are created each time a new user
account is created.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_shadow_utils_create_home: no

.. note::

    On CentOS 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 systems, home directories are
    always created with new users by default. Home directories are not created
    by default on Ubuntu systems.
