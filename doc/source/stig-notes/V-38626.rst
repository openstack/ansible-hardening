V-38626: The LDAP client must use a TLS connection using trust certificates signed by the site CA.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tls_cacertdir or tls_cacertfile directives are required when tls_checkpeer
is configured (which is the default for openldap versions 2.1 and up). These
directives define the path to the trust certificates signed by the site CA.
