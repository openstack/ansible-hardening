V-38484: The operating system, upon successful logon, must display to the user the date and time of the last logon or access via ssh.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users need to be aware of activity that occurs regarding their account.
Providing users with information regarding the date and time of their last
successful login allows the user to determine if any unauthorized activity has
occurred and gives them an opportunity to notify administrators.  At ssh
login, a user must be presented with the last successful login date and time.
