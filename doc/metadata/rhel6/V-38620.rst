The ``chrony`` service is installed to manage clock synchronization for hosts
and to serve as an NTP server for NTP clients. Chrony was chosen over ntpd
because it's actively maintained and has some enhancements for virtualized
environments.

Deployers can opt out of the ``chrony`` installation by setting the following
Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_chrony: no

There are two configurations available for users to adjust chrony's default
configuration:

The ``security_ntp_servers`` variable is a list of NTP servers that
chrony should use to synchronize time. They are set to North American NTP
servers by default.

The ``security_allowed_ntp_subnets`` variable is a list of subnets (in CIDR
notation) that are allowed to reach your servers running chrony. A sane
default is chosen (all RFC1918 networks are allowed), but this can be easily
adjusted.

For more information on chrony, review the `chrony documentation`_ at the
upstream site, or run `man chrony` on a host with chrony installed.
