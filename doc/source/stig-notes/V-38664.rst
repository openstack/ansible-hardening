V-38664: The system package management tool must verify ownership on all files and directories associated with the audit package.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ownership of audit binaries and configuration files that is incorrect could
allow an unauthorized user to gain privileges that they should not have. The
ownership set by the vendor should be maintained. Any deviations from this
baseline should be investigated.
