Ubuntu's default for ``disk_error_action`` is ``SUSPEND``, which actually
only suspends audit logging. That could be a security issue, so ``SYSLOG``
is recommended and is set by default be openstack-ansible-security.  There
are additional options available, like ``EXEC``, ``SINGLE`` or ``HALT``.

To configure a different ``disk_error_action``, set the following Ansible
variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    disk_error_action = SYSLOG

For details on available settings and what they do, run ``man auditd.conf``.
Some options can cause the host to go offline until the issue is fixed.
Deployers are urged to **carefully read the auditd documentation** prior to
changing the ``disk_error_action`` setting from the default.
