The default AIDE configuration in CentOS 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
already uses SHA512 to validate file contents and directories. No changes are
required on these systems.

The tasks in the security role add a rule to end of the AIDE configuration on
Ubuntu systems that uses SHA512 for validation.
