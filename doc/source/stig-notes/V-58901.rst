V-58901: The sudo command must require authentication.
------------------------------------------------------

The "sudo" command allows authorized users to run programs (including shells)
as other users, system users, and root. The "/etc/sudoers" file is used to
configure authorized "sudo" users as well as the programs they are allowed to
run. Some configuration options in the "/etc/sudoers" file allow configured
users to run programs without re-authenticating. Use of these configuration
options makes it easier for one compromised account to be used to compromise
other accounts.
