The role will remove the NIS server package from the system if it is
installed. The package name differs between Linux distributions:

* CentOS: ``ypserv``
* Ubuntu: ``nis``

Deployers can opt-out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_remove_ypserv: no
