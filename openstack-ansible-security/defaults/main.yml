## Disabling services
# The STIG recommends ensuring that some services are running if no services
# utilizing it are enabled.  Setting a boolean to 'yes' here will ensure that
# a service isn't actively running and will not be started after boot-up.
# Setting a 'no' will ensure that this Ansible role does not alter the service
# in any way from its current configuration.

## Removing services
# The STIG recommends ensuring that some services aren't installed at any time.
# Those services are listed here.  Setting a boolean here to 'yes' wiil
# ensure that the STIG is followed and the service is removed.  Setting a
# boolean to 'no' means that the playbook will not alter the service.

## Additional rules for auditd
# The following booleans control the rule sets added to auditd's default
# set of auditing rules.  To see which rules will be added for each boolean,
# refer to the templates/osas-auditd.j2 file.
#
# If the template changes due to booleans being adjusted, the new template
# will be deployed onto the host and auditd will get the new rules loaded
# automatically with augenrules.

#
# V-38608 - Set a 15 minute time out for SSH sessions if there is no activity
ssh_client_alive_interval: 900
# V-38610 - Timeout ssh sessions as soon as ClientAliveInterval is reached once
ssh_client_alive_count_max: 0
# V-38613 - The ssh daemon must not permit root logins
# Deviation from the STIG due to operational requirements in openstack-ansible.
# See documentation for V-38613 for more details.
