Although the STIG requires that security patches and updates are applied when
they are made available, this might be disruptive to some systems. Therefore,
the tasks in the security role will not configure automatic updates by default.

Deployers can opt in for automatic package updates by setting the following
Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_automatic_package_updates: yes

When enabled, the tasks install and configure ``yum-cron`` on CentOS and Red
Hat Enterprise Linux.  On Ubuntu systems, the ``unattended-upgrades`` package
is installed and configured.
