Ubuntu's default for ``space_left_action`` is ``SUSPEND``, which actually
only suspends audit logging. That could be a security issue, so ``SYSLOG``
is recommended and is set by default be openstack-ansible-security. If syslog
messages are being sent to remote servers, these log messages should alert
an administrator about the disk being almost full. There are additional options
available, like ``EXEC``, ``SINGLE`` or ``HALT``.

To configure a different ``space_left_action``, set the following Ansible
variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    space_left_action = SYSLOG

For details on available settings and what they do, run ``man auditd.conf``.
Some options can cause the host to go offline until the issue is fixed.
Deployers are urged to **carefully read the auditd documentation** prior to
changing the ``space_left_action`` setting from the default.
