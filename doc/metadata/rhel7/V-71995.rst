The STIG requires that the umask for all authenticated users is ``077``. This
ensures that all new files and directories created by a user are accessible
only by that user.

Although this change has a significant security benefit, it can cause problems
for users who are not expecting the change. The security role will not adjust
the umask by default.

Deployers can opt-in for the change by setting the default umask with an
Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_shadow_utils_umask: 077

.. note::

    Ubuntu uses ``pam_umask`` and it uses the default umask provided by the
    ``UMASK`` line in ``/etc/login.defs``. The default setting on Ubuntu
    systems is ``022``. This allows the user's group and other users on the
    system to read and execute files, but they cannot write to them.

    CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not use ``pam_umask`` and instead
    set a default umask of ``0002`` for regular users and ``0022`` for root.
    This gives the regular user's group full access to newly created files, but
    other users cannot write to those files.

    The tasks for this STIG requirement are not currently applied to CentOS and
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems. See `Launchpad Bug #1656003`_ for more
    details.
