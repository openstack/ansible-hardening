V-38643: There must be no world-writable files on the system.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Data in world-writable files can be modified by any user on the system. In
almost all circumstances, files can be configured using a combination of user
and group permissions to support whatever legitimate access is needed without
the risk caused by world-writable files.
