V-38648: The qpidd service must not be running.
-----------------------------------------------

The qpidd service is automatically installed when the "base" package selection
is selected during installation. The qpidd service listens for network
connections which increases the attack surface of the system. If the system is
not intended to receive AMQP traffic then the "qpidd" service is not needed
and should be disabled or removed.
