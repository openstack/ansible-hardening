# This file facilitates OpenStack-CI package installation
# before the execution of any tests.
#
# See the following for details:

#  - https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/bindep
#
# Even if the role does not make use of this facility, it
# is better to have this file empty, otherwise OpenStack-CI
# will fall back to installing its default packages which
# will potentially be detrimental to the tests executed.
#
# Note:
# This file is maintained in the openstack-ansible-tests repository.

# If you need to remove or add extra dependencies, you should modify
# the central file instead and once your change is accepted then update
# this file as well. The purpose of this file is to ensure that Python and
# Ansible have all their necessary binary requirements on the test host before
# tox executes. Any binary requirements needed by services/roles should be
# installed by those roles in their applicable package install tasks, not through
# using this file.
