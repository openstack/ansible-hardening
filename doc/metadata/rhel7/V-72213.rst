The STIG requires that a virus scanner is installed and running, but the value
of a virus scanner within an OpenStack control plane or on a hypervisor is
negligible in many cases. In addition, the disk I/O impact of a virus scanner
can impact a production environment negatively.

The security role has tasks to deploy ClamAV with automatic updates, but the
tasks are disabled by default.

Deployers can enable the ClamAV virus scanner by setting the following Ansible
variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_virus_scanner: yes
