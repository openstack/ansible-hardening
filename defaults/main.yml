## AIDE
# The default Ubuntu configuration for AIDE will cause it to wander into some
# terrible places on the system, such as /var/lib/lxc and images in /opt.
# The following three default exclusions are highly recommended for AIDE to
# work properly, but additional exclusions can be added to this list if needed.
security_aide_exclude_dirs:
  - /openstack
  - /opt
  - /run
  - /var

# AIDE database immediately when the playbook finishes, set the following
# variable to 'true':

## Audit daemon
# V-38438 requires that auditd is enabled at boot time with a parameter in the
# GRUB configuration.
#
# If 'security_enable_audit_during_boot' is set to 'yes', then the 'audit=1'
# parameter will be added in /etc/default/grub.d/.

# The following booleans control the rule sets added to auditd's default
# set of auditing rules.  To see which rules will be added for each boolean,
# refer to the templates/osas-auditd.j2 file.
#
# If the template changes due to booleans being adjusted, the new template
# will be deployed onto the host and auditd will get the new rules loaded
# automatically with augenrules.

#
# **DANGER**
# Changing the options below can cause systems to go offline unexpectedly or
# stop serving requests as a security precaution. Read the developer notes for
# each STIG prior to adjusting the following variables.
# **DANGER**
#
# Set an action to occur when there is a disk error. Review the
# documentation for V-38464 before changing this option.
security_disk_error_action: SYSLOG                # V-38464
#
# Set an action to occur when the disk is full. Review the documentation for
# V-38468 before changing this option.
security_disk_full_action: SYSLOG                 # V-38468
#
# V-38678 - Set the amount of megabytes left when the space_left_action
# triggers. The STIG guideline doesn't specify a size, but Ubuntu chooses a
# default of 75MB, which is reasonable.
security_space_left: 75                           # V-38678
#
# Set an action to occur when the disk is approaching its capacity.
# Review the documentation for V-38470 before changing this option.
security_space_left_action: SYSLOG                # V-38470
#
# Set the maximum size of a rotated log file. Ubuntu's default
# matches the STIG requirement of 6MB.
security_max_log_file: 6                          # V 38633
#
# Sets the action to take when log files reach the maximum file size.
# Review the documentation for V-38634 before changing this option.
security_max_log_file_action: ROTATE              # V-38634
#
# Set the number of rotated audit logs to keep.  Ubuntu has 5 as the default
# and this matches the STIG's requirements.

# Set the email address of someone who can receive and respond to notifications
# about low disk space for log volumes.
security_action_mail_acct: root                   # V-38680
#
# **IMMINENT DANGER**
# The STIG says that the system should switch to single user mode when the
# storage capacity gets very low. This can cause serious service disruptions
# and should only be set to 'single' for deployers in extremely high security
# environments. Ubuntu's default is SUSPEND, which will suspend logging.
# **IMMENENT DANGER**
security_admin_space_left_action: SUSPEND         # V-54381

## Chrony (NTP) configuration
# Install and enable chrony to sync time with NTP servers.

# necessary. Set this variable to 'no' to skip this change.
security_disable_core_dumps: yes                  # V-38675

## Services
# The STIG recommends ensuring that some services are running if no services
# utilizing it are enabled.  Setting a boolean to 'yes' here will ensure that
# a service isn't actively running and will not be started after boot-up.
# Setting a 'no' will ensure that this Ansible role does not alter the service
# in any way from its current configuration.

#
# The STIG recommends ensuring that some services aren't installed at ANY time.
# Those services are listed here.  Setting a boolean here to 'yes' wiil
# ensure that the STIG is followed and the service is removed.  Setting a
# boolean to 'no' means that the playbook will not alter the service.
#

security_remove_ypserv: yes                       # V-38603
#
# The STIG does not allow the system to run a graphical interface. Set this
# variable to 'no' if you need a graphical interface on the server.
security_disable_x_windows: yes                   # V-38674

## SSH configuration
# The following configuration items will adjust how the ssh daemon is
# configured.  The recommendations from the RHEL 6 STIG are shown below, but
# they can be adjusted to fit a particular environment.
#
# Set a 15 minute time out for SSH sessions if there is no activity
security_ssh_client_alive_interval: 900           # V-38608
#
# Timeout ssh sessions as soon as ClientAliveInterval is reached once
security_ssh_client_alive_count_max: 0            # V-38610
#
# The ssh daemon must not permit root logins. The default value of 'yes' is a
# deviation from the STIG requirements due to how openstack-ansible operates,
# especially within OpenStack CI gate jobs. See documentation for V-38613 for
# more details.
security_ssh_permit_root_login: 'yes'             # V-38613

## Kernel
# Set these booleans to 'yes' to disable the kernel module (following the
# STIG requirements). Set the boolean to 'no' to ensure no changes are made.
security_disable_module_bluetooth: yes            # V-38682
security_disable_module_dccp: yes                 # V-38514

security_disable_icmpv6_redirects: no             # V-38548
#
# ** DANGER **
# It's strongly recommended to fully understand the effects of changing the
# following sysctl tunables. Refer to the documentation under 'Developer
# Notes' for each of the STIGs below before making any changes.
# ** DANGER **
#
security_sysctl_enable_tcp_syncookies: yes        # V-38539
security_sysctl_enable_martian_logging: no        # V-38528
#
# Deployers who wish to disable IPv6 entirely must set this configuration
# variable to 'yes'. See the documentation for V-38546 before making this
# change.
security_disable_ipv6: no                         # V-38546

# Sets the global challenge ACK counter to a large value such
# that a potential attacker could not reasonably come up against it.
security_set_tcp_challenge_ack_limit: yes    # CVE-2016-5696

## Mail
# The STIG requires inet_interfaces to be set to 'localhost', but Ubuntu will
# configure it to be 'all' when dpkg-reconfigure is unavailable (as it is when
# Ansible installs packages). The default here is 'localhost' to meet the STIG
# requirement, but some deployers may want this set to 'all' if their hosts
# need to receive emails over the network (which isn't common).
#
# See the documentation for V-38622 for more details.
security_postfix_inet_interfaces: localhost       # V-38622
#
# Configuring an email address here will cause hosts to forward the root user's
# email to another address.
#
#security_root_forward_email: user@example.com

## Linux Security Module (LSM)
# AppArmor and SELinux provide powerful security controls on a Linux system
# by setting policies for allowed actions. By setting the following variable
# to true, the appropriate LSM will be enabled for the Linux distribution:
#
#    Ubuntu: AppArmor
#    CentOS: SELinux
#
# See the openstack-ansible-security documentation for more details.
security_enable_linux_security_module: yes        # V-51337

## PAM and authentication
# V-38497 requires that accounts with null passwords aren't allowed to
# authenticate via PAM. Ubuntu 14.04's default allows these logins -- see the
# documentation for V-38497 for more details. Set the variable below to 'yes'
# to remove 'nullok_secure' from the PAM configuration or set it to 'no' to
# leave the PAM configuration unaltered.
security_pam_remove_nullok: yes                   # V-38497
#
# V-38501 requires that failed login attempts must lock a user account using
# pam_faillock, but Ubuntu doesn't package that PAM module. Instead, fail2ban
# can be installed to lock out IP addresses with failed logins for 15 minutes.
# Set the variable below to 'yes' to install and configure fail2ban.
security_install_fail2ban: no                     # V-38501
#
# The STIG requires bans to last 15 minutes. Adjust the following variable
# to set the time an IP is banned by fail2ban (in seconds).
security_fail2ban_bantime: 900                    # V-38501

## Password complexity and aging
# V-38475 - There is no password length requirement by default in Ubuntu 14.04.
# To set a password length requirement, uncomment
# security_password_minimum_length below. The STIG recommendation is 14
# characters.
#security_password_minimum_length: 14             # V-38475
# V-38477 - There is no password change limitation set by default in Ubuntu. To
# set the minimum number of days between password changes, uncomment the
# security_password_minimum_days variable below.  The STIG recommendation is 1
# day.
#security_password_minimum_days: 1                # V-38477
# V-38479 - There is no age limit on password by default in Ubuntu. Uncomment
# line below to use the STIG recommendation of 60 days.
#security_password_maximum_days: 60               # V-38479
# V-38480 - To warn users before their password expires, uncomment the line
# below and they will be warned 7 days prior (following the STIG).
#security_password_warn_age: 7                    # V-38480
# V-38684 - Setting the maximum number of simultaneous logins per user. The
# STIG sets a limit of 10.
#security_max_simultaneous_logins: 10             # V-38684
# V-38692 - Lock accounts that are inactive for 35 days.
#security_inactive_account_lock_days: 35          # V-38692

## sudo
# V-58901 requires that 'NOPASSWD' and '!authenticate' do not appear in any
# sudoers files since they could lead to a compromise. Set the following
# variables to 'yes' to comment out any lines found with these prohibited
# parameters or leave them set to 'no' (the default) to leave sudoers files
# unaltered. Deployers are urged to review the documentation for this STIG
# before making changes.
security_sudoers_remove_nopasswd: no              # V-58901
security_sudoers_remove_authenticate: no          # V-58901

## umask settings
# The STIG recommends changing various default umask settings for users and
# daemons via different methods. However, this could cause serious issues for
# production OpenStack environements which haven't been tested with these
# changes.
#
# The variables below are set to match the STIG requirements, but they are
# commented out to ensure they require deployers to opt-in for each change. To
# opt in for one of the changes below, simply uncomment the line and run the
# playbook. Deployers are strongly advised to review the documentation for
# these changes and review their systems to ensure these changes won't cause
# service disruptions.
#
# V-38642 - Set umask for daemons in init scripts to 027 or 022
#security_umask_daemons_init: 027                 # V-38642
#
# V-38645 - System default umask in /etc/login.defs must be 077
#security_umask_login_defs: 077                   # V-38645
#
# V-38649 - System default umask for csh must be 077
#security_umask_csh: 077                          # V-38649
#
# V-38651 - System default umask for bash must be 077
#security_umask_bash: 077                         # V-38651
