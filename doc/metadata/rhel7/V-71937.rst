The Ansible tasks will ensure that PAM is configured to disallow logins from
accounts with null or blank passwords. This involves removing a single option
from one of the PAM configuration files:

* CentOS or RHEL: removes ``nullok`` from ``/etc/pam.d/system-auth``
* Ubuntu: removes ``nullok_secure`` from ``/etc/pam.d/common-auth``

Deployers can opt-out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

   security_disallow_blank_password_login: no
