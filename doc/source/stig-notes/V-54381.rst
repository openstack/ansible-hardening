V-54381: The audit system must switch the system to single-user mode when available audit storage volume becomes dangerously low.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Administrators should be made aware of an inability to record audit records.
If a separate partition or logical volume of adequate size is used, running
low on space for audit records should never occur.
