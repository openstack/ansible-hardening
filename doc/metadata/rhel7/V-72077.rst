The role will remove the telnet server package from the system if it is
installed. The package name differs between Linux distributions:

* CentOS: ``telnet-server``
* Ubuntu: ``telnetd``

Deployers can opt-out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_remove_telnet_server: no
