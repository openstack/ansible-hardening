The STIG requires that a firewall is configured on each server. This might be
disruptive to some environments since the default firewall policy for
``firewalld`` is very restrictive. Therefore, the tasks in the security role
do not install or enable the ``firewalld`` daemon by default.

Deployers can opt in for this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_firewalld: yes

.. warning::

    Deployers must pre-configure ``firewalld`` or copy over a working XML file
    in ``/etc/firewalld/zones/`` from another server. The default firewalld
    restrictions on Ubuntu, CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux are highly
    restrictive.
