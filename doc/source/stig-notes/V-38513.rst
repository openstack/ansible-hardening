V-38513: The systems local IPv4 firewall must implement a deny-all, allow-by-exception policy for inbound packets.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In "iptables" the default policy is applied only after all the applicable
rules in the table are examined for a match. Setting the default policy to
"DROP" implements proper design for a firewall, i.e., any packets which are
not explicitly permitted should not be accepted.
