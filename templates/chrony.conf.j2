# See www.pool.ntp.org for an explanation of these servers.  Please
# consider joining the project if possible.  If you can't or don't want to
# use these servers I suggest that you try your ISP's nameservers.  We mark
# the servers 'offline' so that chronyd won't try to connect when the link
# is down.  Scripts in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d and /etc/ppp/ip-down.d use chronyc
# commands to switch it on when a dialup link comes up and off when it goes
# down.  Code in /etc/init.d/chrony attempts to determine whether or not
# the link is up at boot time and set the online status accordingly.  If
# you have an always-on connection such as cable omit the 'offline'
# directive and chronyd will default to online.
#
# Note that if Chrony tries to go "online" and dns lookup of the servers
# fails they will be discarded.  Thus under some circumstances it is
# better to use IP numbers than host names.
