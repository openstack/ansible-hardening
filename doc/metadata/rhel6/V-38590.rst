While providing text screen locking does add additional security, deployers
are strongly urged to limit physical access and out-of-band access to
servers where someone else might be able to join a user's session when
they step away. In addition, if a user is logging in remotely via ssh,
they should lock their entire workstation to prevent unauthorized access
to their system as well as the systems they are actively accessing.
